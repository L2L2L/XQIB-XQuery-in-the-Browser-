XQIB-XQuery-in-the-Browser-
===========================

HTML has a cousin. And it also has angle brackets.

XQIB allows you to program client-side Web applications with XQuery instead of, or as a complement to JavaScript. It works in most modern browsers (IE9, Firefox 3.6+, Chrome 8+, Safari 5) and does not require the installation of any plugin.
A W3C Standard.

XQuery is a W3C standard, just like HTML and XML, and is perfectly tailored for working with HTML, XML and REST. This means more elegant programs and less code. Moreover, by using an XQuery Web application server (such as MarkLogic or Sausalito) in conjunction with XQIB, having the same language on both the server and the client side allows you to reuse your code.
